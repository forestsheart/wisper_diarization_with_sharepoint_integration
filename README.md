# wisper_diarization_with_sharepoint_integration
In this repository, we perform the diarization of audio extracted from SharePoint using stable_ts (https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts/tree/main#visualizing-suppression), speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb's  pyannote model, and the pre-processing  audio suggested in approaches-to-diarisation(https://github.com/mirix/approaches-to-diarisation/tree/main)
